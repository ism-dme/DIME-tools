# Usage guide
The most convinient way is to open the project file ( `dime-tools.xpr` ) with the oXygen XML editor. The project contains all transformation and validation scenarios as well as needed settings (in particular, the document type association *DIME-tools_options*). 

Each main stylesheet contains documentation. For better readability it is recommended to use the oXygen built-in documentation generation.

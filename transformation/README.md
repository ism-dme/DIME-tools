# Usage guide
The most convinient way to use the oXygen XML editor project file ( `transformation.xpr` ) which contains all transformation scenarios as well as needed settings. 

Each main stylesheet contains documentation. For better readability it is recommended to use the oXygen built-in documentation generation.

Tested with <oXygen\\> XML Editor 20.1, build 2020010914

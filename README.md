# DIME-tools
This repository contains selected tools which were developed in the context of the [Digital Interactive Mozart Edition][1] and which might be useful for other projects. The tools cover XML transformation with XSLT and validation with schematron. 

## Usage guide
The most convinient way is to open the project file ( `dime-tools.xpr`  ) with the oXygen XML editor. The project contains the transformation and validation scenarios as well as needed settings (in particular, the document type association *DIME-tools_options*). 

Every XSLT-based tool contains documentation which is placed in the main stylesheet. For better readability it is recommended to use the oXygen built-in documentation generation.

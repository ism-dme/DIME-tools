# DIME Tools
The repository contains selected tools which were developed in the context of the [Digital Interactive Mozart Edition][1] and might be useful for other projects which work with [MEI][2] data format. The tools cover XML transformations, data extraction as well as validation. Each main XSLT-file contains documentation for the particular tool.

The most convinient way to use is to open the project file ( `DIME-tools.xpr` ) in the [<oXygen\\> XML Editor][3] which contains all needed settings for transformation and validation scenarios. For some transformations you need to pass options into `options.xml` which should be opened in `Author Mode`.

Developed and tested on <oXygen\\> XML Editor 20.1, build 2020010914 for MEI versions 3.0.0 and 4.0.0-1.

# DIME Tools
This repository contains selected tools which were developed in the context of the [Digital Interactive Mozart Edition][1] and might be useful for other projects. The tools cover XML-MEI transformation and validation operations. 

The most convinient way to use the oXygen XML editor project file ( `DIME-tools.xpr` ) which contains all needed settings.

Tested with <oXygen\\> XML Editor 20.1, build 2020010914

# DIME-tools
This repository contains source code for tools which were developed in the context of the *Digital Interactive Mozart Edition* (currently contains only *checkAccidentalsVisibility*).


## Usage
The most convinient way is to open the oXygen project file ( `dime-tools.xpr`  ) which contains all transformation scenarios and needed settings.
The folder `docs` contains documentation (open checkAccidentalsVisibility.html in your browser).

The folder `mre` contains minimal running test files which are mainly encoded as correct MEI examples. In order to play around with the functionality of the tool make changes there.
